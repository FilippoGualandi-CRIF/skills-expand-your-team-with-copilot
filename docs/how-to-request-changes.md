# How to Request Changes Using Issue Templates

This guide explains how teachers can easily request changes to the school activities website without needing to understand the technical details.

## What Are Issue Templates?

Issue templates are simple forms that guide you through describing what you need changed. They ensure you provide all the necessary information so that the changes can be implemented quickly and accurately.

## How to Create a New Request

1. Go to the [Issues page](../../issues) on GitHub
2. Click the green "New issue" button
3. You'll see several template options - choose the one that best matches your needs
4. Fill out the form with your request details
5. Click "Submit new issue"

That's it! Your request has been submitted and can be reviewed and assigned to the Copilot coding agent.

## Tips for Writing Good Requests

### Be Specific
Instead of: "Make the website look better"
Try: "Change the header background color to lime green (#32CD32) to match our school colors"

### Provide Context
Explain why the change is needed:
- "Students have been requesting this"
- "This will help avoid scheduling conflicts"
- "The current wording is confusing"

### Include Examples
If you have examples or references, include them:
- "Like how Instagram's dark mode works"
- "Similar to the calendar on Google Calendar"
- "Use mascot images from https://octodex.github.com/"

### List Clear Requirements
For features or changes with multiple parts, list them clearly:
- Add a toggle button in the top right
- When clicked, switch to dark colors
- Remember the user's preference

## What Happens After You Submit?

1. Your issue is created with all the information from the form
2. The issue can be reviewed by administrators
3. If approved, it can be assigned to the Copilot coding agent
4. The Copilot agent will implement the changes based on your requirements
5. You'll be notified when the changes are complete

- You can start with any template and explain your needs - we can help clarify

## Important Notes

- **No Technical Skills Required**: The templates are designed for non-technical users. Just describe what you need in plain language.
- **All Information is Helpful**: Include any details that might be relevant, even if you're not sure they're important.
- **Changes Are Reviewed**: All requests are reviewed before being implemented to ensure they meet the school's needs.

Remember: It's better to provide too much information than too little!
